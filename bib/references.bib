  abstract  = {The Assyrian expansion to the west began in earnest with Shalmaneser III. Over the course of twenty-one campaigns and more than thirty years, Shalmaneser succeeded in making many countries in Hatti (northern Syria), as well as the lands Que and Tabalu, his vassals. Moreover, three important coastal cities (Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos) paid tribute, and Jehu, the king of Israel, submitted to Assyrian power. Between 740 and 732 BCE, a large part of the Syria and the Levant was annexed by the Assyrian empire, Tiglath-pileser III. When Shalmaneser died in the winter of 722/721 BCE, the Assyrian army returned to Assyria, and the annexation and reorganization of Samaria was postponed. With Sargon II, Assyria's second extensive annexation phase in the west began. Sargon led half of his campaigns to Syria and the Levant, where the northwestern region, in particular, required his attention.},

  abstract   = {According to the Early Edom hypothesis, the late Iron II kingdom of Edom in southern Jordan emerged from the complex copper-producing society of early Iron II Faynan. A review of the archaeological evidence from the final publication of the Faynan excavations demonstrates that the hypothesis is untenable. There was a chronological gap of 50 to 100+ years between the end of settlement at Faynan, at the end of the 9th century b.c.e., and the earliest settlement in the Edom Highlands; evidence of decreasing social and political complexity at Faynan; no continuity in the scale or technology of copper production at Faynan between early and late Iron II; and completely different settlement patterns at early Iron II Faynan and in the late Iron II highlands, indicating a different economic and social basis. The evidence suggests that early Iron II Faynan was short-lived and linked to the contemporary society in the Negev Highlands, through administration, economy, and workforce. The kingdom of Edom and late Iron II settlement developed in the late 8th century b.c.e. under Assyrian stimulus, which had a direct impact on the expansion of settlement and agriculture, the production of pottery and other goods, and the Arabian trade across the Negev.},

The authors estimate the population for the entire country in the eighth century B. C. E. to have been ca. 400,000 people.

The degree of correlation between climate change and population dynamics can now be accurately quantified, and divergences in the demographic history of distinct geographic areas can be statistically assessed. Here we contribute to this research agenda by reconstructing the prehistoric population change of Jomon hunter-gatherers between 7,000 and 3,000 cal BP. We collected 1,433 14C dates from three different regions in Eastern Japan (Kanto, Aomori and Hokkaido) and established that the observed fluctuations in the SPDs were statistically significant. We also introduced a new non-parametric permutation test for comparing multiple sets of SPDs that highlights point of divergences in the population history of different geographic regions. Our analyses indicate a general rise-and-fall pattern shared by the three regions but also some key regional differences during the 6th millennium cal BP. The results confirm some of the patterns suggested by previous archaeological studies based on house and site counts but offer statistical significance and an absolute chronological framework that will enable future studies aiming to establish potential correlation with climatic changes.},

This database assessment and review of listed archaeological sites included the verification of site existence and the examination of sites’ modern context, accessibility, current condition, potential threats, and the accuracy of their recorded location. The results of this fieldwork demonstrate the importance of keeping data up-do-date, provide suggestions on how to enhance the structure and contents of current inventories, and help prioritize and inform plans for further archaeological fieldwork in this region.},

The site, consisting of a prominent stone platform documented as early as the 19th century and other recently discovered structural remains, is interpreted as a Judahite outpost built in a strategic location within the oasis of En-Gedi. On the basis of the ceramic assemblage, it is suggested that this site was founded during the early 7th century BCE and was abandoned before the end of that century—making it the earliest Iron Age occupation in the oasis. Combined with historical considerations and a regional analysis, the En-Gedi Spring site enhances our understanding of the Judahite expansion into the Judaean Desert during the late Iron Age.},

In addition to providing a brief overview of the primary source material—in particular royal inscriptions and correspondence, two genres of texts that record some details about Assyria’s numerous interactions with the outside world—this contribution examines certain key events in order to highlight the empire’s complex relationship with its neighbors, rivals, and allies. These include Ashurnasirpal II’s lavish festivities that inaugurated his newly constructed palace and capital at Kalhu; the Battle of Qarqar between Shalmaneser III and a coalition of twelve Levantine kings; Esarhaddon’s public nomination of his royal successors on the thrones of Assyria and Babylon; the “brother war” between Ashurbanipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukin; and the fall of Assyria. The chapter also addresses external influences on Assyria, in particular the incorporation of Anatolian architectural features into Assyrian royal residences; Babylon’s function as a model for Sargon II’s new capital Dur-Šarrukin; and that city’s influence on the cult and temple of the god Aššur during the reign of Sennacherib.},

Yet the course that extensification takes in particular instances is unpredictable given the choices available to producers. This article investigates an instance of extensification during the late second millennium BCE on the semi-arid Eastern Karak Plateau in west-central Jordan. Architectural, faunal, and archaeobotanical evidence is presented from Khirbat al-Mudayna al-'Aliya, one of several communities that participated in an extensified settlement system on the edge of the Wadi al-Mujib and its tributaries. Producers practiced agriculture and pastoralism in a low-intensity subsistence economy that supported a nucleated settlement of households. Faunal analysis determined goats were kept, and wild animals supplemented diets. Archaeobotanical analysis of charred plant remains from storage bins in a building destroyed by fire indicated that barley was stored in a semi-processed state and that harvesting by uprooting was practiced, thus resulting in the maximization of the straw harvest. The riparian zone beneath the settlement was a key venue for subsistence activities. This Early Iron Age example contrasts with later episodes of extensification whose settlement systems were more dispersed and agro-pastoralist regime more integrated.},

Known primarily from references in the Hebrew Bible, Moab has long occupied a marginal position, one defined by the complex interrelationship of history, theology, and politics that underlies biblical archaeology. Moab in the Iron Age: Hegemony, Polity, Archaeology inverts this position, using Moab as the centerpiece of an extended reflection on the nature and meaning of state formation.Focusing on the state as an effect rather than a cause, Bruce Routledge examines the constitution of the kingdom over a period of some seven hundred years. In particular, he develops Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony by examining the ways intellectual products, such as inscriptions, public buildings, and administrative practices, transformed local cultural resources in order to construct political dominance as a moral order. Through a careful analysis that combines archaeology and textual study, Routledge demonstrates how long-established principles underlying local identities were transformed when appropriated for particular state building projects. From this, he offers insights into the realization and historical reproduction of political power in everyday life.Rich in previously unpublished material, Moab in the Iron Age reinvigorates discussions of politics and culture in early complex societies, and presents a novel approach to the study of state formation.},

Israel and Judah were two such polities and their story reflects, in many ways, the story of the Iron Age Levant. This chapter offers a survey and critique of the social and political histories of Israel and Judah, reconstructed in light of both archaeological research and textual sources, whether biblical or extra-biblical. It discusses Israel and Judah in their Levantine context, while referring also to the question of their possible unity; their transformation and growth in the ninth–eighth centuries bc (including their administrative apparatus and urban nature); and finally, their fate in the shadow of the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires, and the imperial impact on local societies, as reflected in material remains and written sources.},

  abstract   = {Between 732 and 720 BCE, the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel marked a pivotal moment in the political history of the southern Levant, culminating in the establishment of the provinces of Magiddû and Samerina. The imprint of Assyrian dominance on these regions is evident through various archaeological remnants, reflecting the profound impact of the empire on local communities. This paper intends to delve into the transformation of settlement patterns within these provinces, elucidating their political and economic role within the empire and the extent of imperial territorial exploitation within the dynamic political landscape of the southern Levant. Central to this investigation is the assertion that the Assyrian administration favoured a process of ruralization within the newly formed provinces, characterized by the emergence of distinct ‘islands of control’. These are clusters of sites formed by a few administrative centres surrounded by a constellation of farm sites, interconnected by a network of roads. This recurring phenomenon emerges as a consistent motif throughout the Assyrian Empire, underscoring a strategy of territorial organization geared towards efficiently managing agricultural resources.},
