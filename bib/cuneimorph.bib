  abstract = {Cuneiform script is normally studied by means of two dimensional images, whether hand copies or photographs. The paper aims at exploring the potential of modern 3D data processing and analysis technologies to enhance the analysis of cuneiform script, focusing on its basic element, the wedge. In order to establish a consistent terminological framework for the description of its components, the wedge is considered primarily in its idealized geometrical form, the tetrahedron. The factors that contribute to determine the actual shape of wedge impressions are subsequently singled out and discussed in detail. Finally, the results of an experimental analysis conducted on the wedges' inner angles of six Hittite tablets are presented, being only the `thin edge of the wedge', in order to illustrate the potential of 3D techniques for script analysis and handwriting identification within cuneiform studies.}

  abstract = {Cuneiform tablets, emerging in ancient Mesopotamia around the late fourth millennium BCE, represent one of humanity's earliest writing systems. Characterized by wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, these artifacts provided insight into Mesopotamian civilization across various domains. Traditionally, the analysis and dating of these tablets rely on subjective assessment of shape and writing style, leading to uncertainties in pinpointing their exact temporal origins. Recent advances in digitization have revolutionized the study of cuneiform by enhancing accessibility and analytical capabilities. Our research uniquely focuses on the silhouette of tablets as significant indicators of their historical periods, diverging from most studies that concentrate on textual content. Utilizing an unprecedented dataset of over 94,000 images from the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative collection, we apply deep learning methods to classify cuneiform tablets, covering over 3,000 years of history. By leveraging statistical, computational techniques, and generative modeling through Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we achieve substantial advancements in the automatic classification of these ancient documents, focusing on the tablets' silhouettes as key predictors. Our classification approach begins with a Decision Tree using height-to-width ratios and culminates with a ResNet50 model, achieving a 61\% macro F1-score for tablet silhouettes. Moreover, we introduce novel VAE-powered tools to enhance explainability and enable researchers to explore changes in tablet shapes across different eras and genres. This research contributes to document analysis and diplomatics by demonstrating the value of large-scale data analysis combined with statistical methods. These insights offer valuable tools for historians and epigraphists, enriching our understanding of cuneiform tablets and the cultures that produced them.},

  abstract = {The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge in the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform signs have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare signs. Our code, data, and trained models are available at the project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/ProtoSnap/},

  abstract = {Geometric Morphometrics (GM) is a method originally applied in Evolutionary Biology studies, using the analysis of change in size and shape in order to better understand ontogenetic sequences, phylogenetic relations, among other issues. The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies.},
