  abstract = {The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge in the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform signs have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare signs. Our code, data, and trained models are available at the project page: https://tau-vailab.github.io/ProtoSnap/},

  abstract = {Geometric Morphometrics (GM) is a method originally applied in Evolutionary Biology studies, using the analysis of change in size and shape in order to better understand ontogenetic sequences, phylogenetic relations, among other issues. The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies.},
