- A "copilot" historian: answers need to be explainable, no black-boxes
:::

- Is the trajectory of the spread of cuneiform from Mesopotamia to the west retraceable using palaeography?



- Created a benchmark corpus: 272 images, 25 sign classes, with expert-annotated landmark points
- Compared expert labels to model predictions
- - The task is challenging due to subjectivity and expert disagreement
- - Demonstrated success on Hittite cuneiform, which the model had never seen before
- (F1 score: 27.14% vs. 16.14% at 20-pixel threshold)

Superimposing shapes to measure differences is a relatively recent method in morphometrics.
The Procrustes method, first used in multivariate statistics, was adapted for shape analysis.
The term “Procrustes” comes from Greek mythology: Procrustes forced victims to fit his bed by stretching or cutting them.
Similarly, Procrustes analysis fits and scales one shape onto another for comparison.



- NEED: Cropped and identified sign images (potentially in the hundreds or thousands)
